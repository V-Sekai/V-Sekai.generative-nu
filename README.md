# V-Sekai.generative-nu

takes a 3d mesh and improves it 

take a static gltf, run automatic weighting, run cloth sim, and output a vrm 

take a vrm and upload to v-sekai cdn 

take a gltf and generate a collision hull https://github.com/SarahWeiii/CoACD 

given a room description, place objects to fit the scene and then export as .blend or gltf 

I have a tool that generate images via procedural math and returns a image

Take procedural math and then assign them to a gltf object and output a gltf

generate a 2km bitmap for a terrain and then create a gltf terrain 

so the idea is to make a shell based data processor, which is similar to what PowerShell was trying to do but not windows specific
a series of json utilities piped together

can be anything tabular. even sqlite 

the goal is I want to fill a hundred worlds in game dev generatively 

so I can't personally do it with linear performance. it's only possible with automation 

So it has this concept of jsonrpc plugins

I have a jsonrpc proof of concept for blender and if I can get it into nushell, I can also do a create, update and delete objects.
